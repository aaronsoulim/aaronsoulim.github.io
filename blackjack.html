<h2>I have added betting!<br>As I didn't want to brute force my way through this task, implementation took about 4 hours 
this time, most trouble was figuring out an efficient way of presenting
the players money (and trying to navigate my code, hehe...)<br>
Money is stored in a save file: If you have no money, the house provides; If you have
no money after a hand, you get kicked out!<br>Pressing [m] allows you to see how much money you have (had to perform a
Decimal to ASCII conversion, which you can see shows 100s, 10s and 1s<br>You can double down!<br>Blackjack provides 3/2
times your bet (or rounded approximation)<br>The test images below will show you what's up:<br>(I also spent a bit of time
making the final product look prettier)<br></h2>

<p style="font-family:papyrus">Addendum:<br>Soft 17 means dealer stands on A[6] - where 6 is the final value of the dealer's other 4 cards.<br>
This means the dealer doesn't get the chance to increase their hand to 21, reducing house edge by ~0.2%.<br>I have not played my game enough to notice what
I actually implemented, and tbh, I've forgotten my intended implemenation<br>(probably Hard 17 but idk lol)</p>
<p style="font-family:papyrus">Addendum 2:<br>It's stand on Soft 17...<br>~0.2%, nice</p><br>
