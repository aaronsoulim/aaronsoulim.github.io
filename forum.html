This latest project started as PHP and SQL learning experience, and over the 7 days (in free time between work and puppy-caring, it quickly devolving into delusions of innovation and soon realising
I was simply creating platforms that already exist.
<br><br>
Anyway, I DID learn a lot with regards to PHP and SQL syntax and logic - including:
$_POST,  $_SESSION, and $_GET variables<br>
sesson_id() and password_hash()<br>
SQL prepared statements (-&gt;bind_param, -&gt;fetch, etc.) and input sanitation to mitgitate XSS and SQL Injection attack vectors<br>
foreach loops WRT array()<br><br><br>
I began sorting out accounts and authorisation, where in the final form each user has a UID, unique username, creation and last-login timestamp, session_id and email
<br>Each user also has the ability to change their password<br>I also allowed for liking posts (along with like counter), viewing liked posts, post management (deletion) and post searching.
<br>In between coding sessions, I also became more familiar with VIM, mariadb and ARCH linux, a naive example: bash scripts and server-side php scripts to remove stale sessions (&gt; 5 hours) from /tmp (therefore closing the session) and from the USERS table. Otherwise, I have just been gaining a general comfortability with the components<br>
I got to develop my HTML skills, with FORMs & href="forum.php?[variable]=" - and JavaScript, with href="#" & "javascript:void(0)"<br> I also discovered font copyright laws and learnt some CSS for @font-face...<br>I decided to finish this project early as to redirect my ambition toward a TEXT-BASED MMORPG, otherwise, I would have 
liked to extend the search feature to the Manage Posts and Liked pages; As well as implementing a Background PHP script using AJAX<br></div>
